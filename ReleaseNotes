Release Notes for FreeNAS 9.2.1.6-BETA

o  Added extra safety belts and sane ACL behavior for CIFS sharing.

Now when a ZFS dataset is created with the type set to Windows, or a Windows share is created
on an existing dataset with "Default Permissions" checked (a new GUI option in the CIFS sharing
dialog), FreeNAS will make sure that the ACLs / ownerships are set properly for Windows and it
will also make sure that the behavior of chmod(2) is set in ZFS such that it does not also
destroy the Inherit, Delete or Delete Child ACLs whenever it's used.

o The System Dataset now has its own Settings UI that allows you to control the placement of
various sub-datasets under it.

o The System Dataset will now migrate if you change the pool assignment, preserving your data
and also moving it off the previous pool.

o A new Virtualbox jail template has been added.  Supporting Virtualbox in a jail is as easy
as creating an instance of this template.
