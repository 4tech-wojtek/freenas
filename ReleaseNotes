Release Notes for FreeNAS 9.2.1.8-RELEASE

o Fix bug where use of NONE cipher in replication erroneously reported an
  error on a successful replication.

o Don't enable lz4 compression on replication by default if upgrading from
  a pre-9.2.1.7 release.

o Multiple kernel iSCSI / CTL improvements.  This includes VMWare VAAI and
  Microsoft ODX acceleration support, improved performance and fixes for
  number of bugs. Kernel iSCSI can be activated by checking the experimental
  target checkbox under services -> iSCSI.

o Improve performance of viewing snapshots when replication tasks are set up.

o Allow binding CIFS to specific IPs.

o Fix LDAP bind URL when using TLS.

o Validate AD advanced settings.  If the GC or DC are manually specified
  make sure they are reachable.

o Set UNIX permissions when the Mac permissions radio button is selected.
  Netatalk does not play nicely with ACLs.

o Fix a bug in the mail sending routines used by FreeNAS. With some mailserver
  configurations the To: address could've been set to root instead of the
  address specified in the root user.

o Fix a bug that prevented  the system from showing the replicated status of
  a snapshot if the remote path differed from the local path.

o "Shellshock" security vulnerability in bash (which is not the system shell
  FreeNAS or FreeBSD) proactively closed.
