Release Notes for TrueNAS 9.3-RELEASE -- Organized by category

[ Installation / Booting ]

* TrueNAS now uses ZFS for the mirrored SATA DOMs, the features of ZFS
utilized to provide cloned "boot environments" which allow the system
to be rolled back to previous OS versions.  A boot-time menu is also
provided for selecting and booting from a specific boot environment.

* An install-time "Setup Wizard" is now provided to lead users who may be
new to TrueNAS through the installation and setup process.


[ Updating ]

* While the old manual, monolithic installation and update system is still
supported, TrueNAS has refactored its releases into cryptographically signed
packages, supplied from a secure update server.  This server can be polled
automatically (default: once per day), any available updates being downloaded
automatically.  When new updates have been downloaded, the user will receive
an alert and be given the opportunity to apply them.

[ File sharing ]

* WebDAV file sharing is now supported.

* Samba upgraded to 4.1.17.  Home sharing substantially improved.

* NFSv4 support added, including kerberized NFS.

* Kernel iSCSI (CTL) has completely replaced the old iSCSI code, adding
support for VMWare VAAI (all 7 primitives), MS ODX and Windows 2012 Clustering
as well as much higher performance and space efficiency (zero'd blocks can now
be reclaimed).  Support for STUN and pool storage thresholds also makes VMWare
behavior far more robust when ZFS pools fill up.

* Kernel iSCSI sequential read performance has been sped up
considerably by improving the way such read requests interact with ZFS

* iSCSI nows supports associating to an iSNS server.

* AFP now allows allowhosts and denyhosts per share.

[ Directory Services ]

* AD / LDAP configurations are validated immediately after input.

* Kerberos Realms and Keytabs have joined the Direcory Services UI.

* Directory Services now based on SSSD (System Security Services Daemon) and
connections to LDAP servers done with SSL/TLS.


[ User Interface ]

* The interface tabs are completely gone and the UI refactored to put
most common UI options first, more esoteric options hidden behind
Advanced modes.

* Settings and Directory Services UIs completely revamped and streamlined.

* Many hitherto difficult to discover features have been moved into their
own sub-categories, new icons also being added where applicable.  The
tree menu and the top-level icons have also been synchronized.

* New UI for CA and Certificate management.

* All tunables have been merged - loader, sysctl and rc.conf variables can
be managed from the same UI.


[ Security ]

* Software updates are cryptographically signed and validated, rendering the
hashes unnecessary for anything but manual updates.

* All passwords for services which have been associated with a TrueNAS
storage device (e.g. AD, LDAP, VMWare, etc) are encrypted in the database.

* Current with all FreeBSD and OpenSSL security advisories as of 2015-02-26

[ Miscellaneous ]

* ZFS snapshots can now be coordinated with VMWare so that whenever a
scheduled or manual snapshot is taken, snapshots of the VMs associated
with the related datastore are first done, then the ZFS snapshot is taken.
The temporary VMWare snapshots are then deleted on the VMWare side, so as
not to impact performance, but still exist in the ZFS snapshot and can be
used as "stable resurrection points" in that snapshot.
These "coordinated snapshots" can be found (and are specifically marked
as such) in the snapshot UI.
