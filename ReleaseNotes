Release Notes for FreeNAS 9.2.1.6-BETA

o  Samba updated to 4.1.8, ldb to version 1.1.17, and tdb to version 1.3.0

o  Netatalk updated to 3.1.2

o  Added extra safety belts and sane ACL behavior for CIFS sharing.

	Now when a ZFS dataset is created with the type set to Windows, or a
	Windows share is created on an existing dataset with "Apply Default
	Permissions" checked (a new GUI option in the CIFS sharing dialog),
	FreeNAS will make sure that the ACLs / ownerships are set properly
	for Windows and it will also make sure that the behavior of chmod(2)
	is set in ZFS such that it does not also destroy the Inherit, Delete
	or Delete Child ACLs whenever it's used.

o The System Dataset now has its own Settings UI that allows you to control
the placement of various sub-datasets under it.

o The System Dataset will now migrate if you change the pool assignment,
preserving your data and also moving it off the previous pool.

o Several bugs which broke ZFS snapshot replication when snapshots expired
before replication could complete successfully, or if the connection between
the replication peers failed, have been fixed.

o A new Virtualbox jail template has been added.  Supporting Virtualbox in a
jail is as easy as creating an instance of this template.

o The ISO installation image can, in addition to being used as CD install
media, also now be written to a USB device and booted directly.  To facilitate
this, the installer uses the GRUB boot manager.
