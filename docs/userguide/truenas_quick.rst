.. index:: Out-of-Band Management

.. _Out-of-Band Management:

Out-of-Band Management
----------------------

Before attempting to configure TrueNAS® for out-of-band management, ensure that the out-of-band management port is connected to an appropriate network. Refer
to the guide included with your TrueNAS® Storage Appliance for detailed instructions on how to connect to a network.

Make sure to connect the out-of-band management port **before** powering on the TrueNAS® Storage Appliance. 

In most cases, the out-of-band management interface will have been pre-configured by iXsystems. This section contains instructions for configuring it from the
BIOS if needed. Alternately, if you have already have access to the TrueNAS® administrative graphical interface, the same settings can be configured using
the instructions in :ref:`IPMI`.

To access the system BIOS, press "F2" at the splash screen when booting the TrueNAS® Storage Appliance. This will open the menu shown in Figure 3.5a.

**Figure 3.5a: Initial BIOS Screen**

.. image:: images/tn_BIOS1.png
   
Navigate to the "Server Mgmt" menu and then "BMC LAN Configuration", as shown in Figure 3.5b.

**Figure 3.5b: Navigate to BMC LAN Configuration**

.. image:: images/tn_BIOS2.png
   
If you will be using DCHP to assign the out-of-band management IP address, leave the "Configuration Source" set to "Dynamic" in the screen shown in Figure
3.5c. If an IP has been assigned by DHCP, it will be displayed.

**Figure 3.5c: Configuring a Dynamic IP Address**

.. image:: images/tn_BIOS3.png

To instead assign a static IP address for out-of-band management, set the "Configuration Source" to "Static", as seen in the example shown in Figure 3.5d.
Enter the desired IP Address into the "IP Address" setting, filling out all four octets completely.

**Figure 3.5d: Configuring a Static IP Address**

.. image:: images/tn_BIOS4.png
   
Next, enter the "Subnet Mask" of the subnet within which you wish to have access to out-of-band management. An example is seen in Figure 3.5e.

**Figure 3.5e: Entering the Subnet Mask**

.. image:: images/tn_BIOS5.png

Finally, set the "Default Gateway Address" for the network to which the out-of-band management port is connected. An example is seen in Figure 3.5f.

**Figure 3.5f: Entering the Default Gateway Address**

.. image:: images/tn_BIOS6.png

Save the changes you have made, exit the BIOS, and allow the system to boot.

To connect to the TrueNAS® Storage Appliance using the out-of-band management port, input the configured IP address into a web browser from a computer that
is either within the same network or which is directly wired to the appliance. As seen in Figure 3.5g, a login prompt will appear.

**Figure 3.5g: Connecting to the IPMI Graphical Interface**

.. image:: images/tn_IPMIlogin.png

Login using the default "Username" of *admin* and the default "Password" of
*password*.

You can change the default administrative password using the instructions in :ref:`IPMI`.

Once logged in, click the "vKVM and Media" button at the top right to download the Java KVM Client. Run the client by clicking the "Launch Java KVM Client"
button shown in Figure 3.5h.

**Figure 3.5h: Launching the Java KVM Client**

Once the out-of-band console opens, you can control the TrueNAS® Storage Appliance as if you were using a directly-connected keyboard and monitor.

.. index:: Console Setup Menu
.. _Console Setup Menu:

Console Setup Menu
------------------------------

Once you have completed setting up the hardware for the TrueNAS® Storage Appliance, boot the system. The Console Setup menu, shown in Figure 3.6a, will
appear at the end of the boot process. If you have access to the TrueNAS® system's keyboard and monitor, this Console Setup menu can be used to administer
the system should the administrative GUI become inaccessible.

.. note:: you can access the Console Setup menu from within the TrueNAS® GUI by typing :command:`/etc/netcli` from :ref:`Shell`. You can disable the Console
   Setup menu by unchecking the "Enable Console Menu" in `System --> Settings --> Advanced`.

**Figure 3.6a: TrueNAS® Console Setup Menu**

.. image:: images/console1a.png

This menu provides the following options:

**1) Configure Network Interfaces:** provides a configuration wizard to configure the system's network interfaces.

**2) Configure Link Aggregation:** allows you to either create a new link aggregation or to delete an existing link aggregation.

**3) Configure VLAN Interface:** used to create or delete a VLAN interface.

**4) Configure Default Route:** used to set the IPv4 or IPv6 default gateway. When prompted, input the IP address of the default gateway.

**5) Configure Static Routes:** will prompt for the destination network and the gateway IP address. Re-enter this option for each route you need to add.

**6) Configure DNS:** will prompt for the name of the DNS domain then the IP address of the first DNS server. To input multiple DNS servers, press
:kbd:`Enter` to input the next one. When finished, press :kbd:`Enter` twice to leave this option.

**7) Reset Root Password:** if you are unable to login to the graphical administrative interface, select this option and follow the prompts to set the *root*
password.

**8) Reset to factory defaults:** if you wish to delete
**all** of the configuration changes made in the administrative GUI, select this option. Once the configuration is reset, the system will reboot. You will
need to go to :menuselection:`Storage --> Volumes --> Import Volume` to re-import your volume.

**9) Shell:** enters a shell in order to run FreeBSD commands. To leave the shell, type :command:`exit`.

**10) System Update:** if any system updates are available, they will automatically be downloaded and applied. The functionality is the same as described in
:ref:`Update`, except that the updates will be applied immediately and access to the GUI is not required.

**11) Create backup:** used to backup the TrueNAS® configuration and ZFS layout, and, optionally, the data, to a remote system over an encrypted connection.
The only requirement for the remote system is that it has sufficient space to hold the backup and it is running an SSH server on port 22. The remote system
does not have to be formatted with ZFS as the backup will be saved as a binary file. When this option is selected, it will prompt for the hostname or IP
address of the remote system, the name of a user account on the remote system, the password for that user account, the full path to a directory on the remote
system to save the backup, whether or not to also backup all of the data, whether or not to compress the data, and a confirmation to save the values, where
"y" will start the backup, "n" will repeat the configuration, and "q" will quit the backup wizard. If you leave the password empty, key-based authentication
will be used instead. This requires that the public key of the *root* user is stored in :file:`~root/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote system and that key
should **not** be protected by a passphrase. Refer to :ref:`Rsync over SSH Mode` for instructions on how to generate a key pair.

**12) Restore from a backup:** if a backup has already been created using "11) Create backup" or :menuselection:`System --> Advanced --> Backup`, it can be
restored using this option. Once selected, it will prompt for the hostname or IP address of the remote system holding the backup, the username that was used,
the password (leave empty if key-based authentication was used), the full path of the remote directory storing the backup, and a confirmation that the values
are correct, where "y" will start the restore, "n" will repeat the configuration, and "q" will quit the restore wizard. The restore will indicate if it could
log into the remote system, find the backup, and indicate whether or not the backup contains data. It will then prompt to restore TrueNAS® from that backup.
Note that if you press "y" to perform the restore, the system will be returned to the database configuration, ZFS layout, and optionally the data, at the
point when the backup was created. The system will reboot once the restore is complete.

.. warning:: the backup and restore options are meant for disaster recovery. If you restore a system, it will be returned to the point in time that the backup
             was created. If you select the option to save the data, any data created after the backup was made will be lost. If you do **not** select the
             option to save the data, the system will be recreated with the same ZFS layout, but with **no** data.

.. warning:: the backup function **IGNORES ENCRYPTED POOLS**. Do not use it to backup systems with encrypted pools.

**13) Reboot:** reboots the system.

**14) Shutdown:** halts the system.

During boot, TrueNAS® will automatically try to connect to a DHCP server from all live interfaces. If it successfully receives an IP address, it will display
the IP address which can be used to access the graphical console. In the example seen in Figure 3a, the TrueNAS® system is accessible from
*http://10.2.1.115*.

If your TrueNAS® server is not connected to a network with a DHCP server, you can use the network configuration wizard to manually configure the interface as
seen in Example 3.6a. In this example, the TrueNAS® system has one network interface (*em0*).

Once the system has an IP address, input that address into a graphical web browser from a computer capable of accessing the network containing the TrueNAS®
system. You should be prompted to input the password for the *root* user, as seen in Figure 3.6b.

**Figure 3.6b: Input the Root Password**

Enter the default password of *abcd1234*. You should then see the administrative GUI as shown in the example in Figure 3.6c.

.. note:: you can change the default *root* password to a more secure value by going to `Account --> Users --> View Users`. Highlight the entry for
          *root*, click the "Modify User" button, enter the new password in the "Password" and "Password confirmation" fields, and click "OK" to save the new
          password to use on subsequent logins.

If you are unable to access the IP address from a browser, check the following:

* Are proxy settings enabled in the browser configuration? If so, disable the settings and try connecting again.

* If the page does not load, make sure that you can :command:`ping` the TrueNAS® system's IP address. If the address is in a private IP address range, you
  will only be able to access the system from within the private network.

* If the user interface loads but is unresponsive or seems to be missing menu items, try using a different web browser. IE9 has known issues and will not
  display the graphical administrative interface correctly if compatibility mode is turned on. If you can't access the GUI using Internet Explorer, use
  `Firefox <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/>`_ instead.

* If you receive "An error occurred!" messages when attempting to configure an item in the GUI, make sure that the browser is set to allow cookies from
  the TrueNAS® system.

This
`blog post <http://fortysomethinggeek.blogspot.com/2012/10/ipad-iphone-connect-with-freenas-or-any.html>`_
describes some applications which can be used to access the TrueNAS® system from an iPad or iPhone.

.. _Initial Configuration Wizard:

The rest of this Guide describes all of the configuration screens available within the TrueNAS® graphical administrative interface. The screens are listed in
the order that they appear within the tree, or the left frame of the graphical interface.

.. note:: iXsystems recommends that you contact your iXsystems Support Representative for initial setup and configuration assistance.

Once your system has been configured and you are familiar with the configuration workflow, the rest of this document can be used as a reference guide to the
features built into the TrueNAS® Storage Appliance.

.. note:: it is important to use the graphical interface (or the console setup menu) for all non-ZFS configuration changes. TrueNAS® uses a configuration
   database to store its settings. If you make changes at the command line, they will not be written to the configuration database. This means that these
   changes will not persist after a reboot and will be overwritten by the values in the configuration database during an upgrade.
