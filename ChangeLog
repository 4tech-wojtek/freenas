o HA support has been completely refactored.  All implementation details of
  HA are now completely hidden from the UI and automatically configured by
  the system.

o Improvements in VMWare VAAI Block XCOPY performance.  This results in
  direct performance improvements of storage vmotions and template
  deploys that are hardware accelerated.

o A DTrace script named zfslower.d has been added to the image which
  aids troubleshooting of storage latency problems.  This script can
  be used to determine if the ZFS pool is the cause of latency.

o Fix a bug that always enabled Samba as Local Master, no matter how it
  was configured in the GUI.

o Automatically remove unavailable devices from ZFS pools when they are
  replaced.  This addresses a bug where the "ghost" of a failed and
  subsequently replaced drive could cause a pool to report as DEGRADED.

o Address an issue that would cause grub to taste every drive in a pool
  when updating certain types of tunables in the GUI.  For systems with
  large numbers of drives this could cause a noticable delay in the GUI.

o Improve SNMP support of ZFS attributes.

o Update HBA storage drivers to version 20.  This requires a firmware flash
  of the HBAs which is performed automatically by the update process.

o Update TrueNAS to include FreeBSD security advisories 15:17 and older.
  See http://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories.html for the included updates.

o Fix a bug that could prevent the recycle bin from working on windows shares.

o Improve LDAP and AD support for directories with large numbers of users.
