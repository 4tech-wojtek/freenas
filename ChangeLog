o Add a vCenter plugin.  This functionality allows you to install
  the TrueNAS 1.0 vCenter plugin in to vCenter, which will then
  allow you to create iSCSI and NFS datastores directly from vCenter.

o Fix a bug that prevented ZFS replication from working when
  ssh encryption is disabled.

o Fix two bugs with hardware detection on the Z-series platform.
  The first issue was caused by using a hardwired path to the
  internal enclosure, The second issue was caused by hard wiring
  the device name of the failover link.  Both issues were resolved
  by switching to dynamic runtime detection of the components.

o Improve the workflow for reconfiguring the network configuration
  of TrueNAS HA.  Disable failover, then make changes.  Verify the
  changes have propagated to the STANDBY node, then re-enable failover.
  (Ignore the warning that changing the network will cause a failover,
  with failover disabled it won't.  This warning is a bug that will be
  resolved in a future update)


o Fix a bug that would prevent iSCSI initiators from failing over
  properly on TrueNAS HA.  This regression was introduced when the
  previous update added ALUA support.
