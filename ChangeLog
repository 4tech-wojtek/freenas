Enhancements:

o Add support for allowing NFSv3 style user/group mapping when
  using NFSv4.

o Add a CLI tool to show alerts.  This is useful when the alert
  is originating from the STANDBY node and isn't visible in the
  GUI.

Critical Fixes:

o Address several AD integration bugs and scalability issues.
  Add an option to avoid caching AD objects in the UI.

o Warn about network connectivity interruptions when a VLAN
  interface is added.

o Improve smartd monitoring on the STANDBY node of an HA pair
  to avoid the condition where with certain hard drives the
  STANDBY node would always alert that the smartd service was
  not running.

o Improve failover speed on HA units.

o Alert if one node of an HA pair gets stuck applying it's
  config journal. This condition could block future config
  changes from being applied to the STANDBY node.

o Fix the Force Takeover button in the STANDBY node GUI.

Non-Critical Fixes:

o Fix samba logging when attempting to use syslog.

o Fix an issue that resulted in the node names being swapped in the
  Save Debug output.

o Add the jed editor.

o Add the status of the alert subsystem to the save debug output.

o Fix the GUI zvol creation screen to only allow block sizes that
  are usable for zvols. (Previously any block size supported by ZFS
  was allowed, the "extended" block sizes > 128K are not supported
  by ZFS.

o Improve error reporting when ZFS repolication fails.  In particular
  provide better assesment as to why the replication has failed.

o Improve performance of multipath assembly and enclosure sync.
  This improves boot time substantially.
