o Fix an iSCSI kernel panic.

o Fix an error in the HA takeover path that could
  result in the STANDBY node seeing storage traffic
  before it has assumed the MASTER role.

o Fix several replication bugs that could cause a
  replication task to restart or display the incorrect
  status in the GUI.

o Provide a way to disallow an AD join from updating
  DNS.  This can be useful when TrueNAS systems have
  multiple interfaces but only one DNS record is
  desired.

o Provide a means for each node in an HA pair having
  a unique NETBIOS name when LDAP is enabled.

o Verify certificate chains for self signed SSL certs
  when the CA is uploaded into the GUI.  This allows
  self signed SSL certs to be used for AD authentication.

o Require failover to be disabled on an HA system before
  allowing any changes to the networking config.  This
  prevents a failover event from occuring and allows
  changes to propagate to the STANDBY node.

o Map local groups created on TrueNAS to Windows/Samba
  groups.

o Add support for ssh authentication via kerberos.

o Hide the NFSv4 security fields when NFSv4 is
  disabled.
